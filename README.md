1. Always do npm install in the backend folder (not in other folder!) or copy and paste this below in the terminal:
npm install

2. then, write or copy and paste this below in the terminal:
npm start

3. And then go to the browser and write:
localhost:5000

if you get error for example: {"message":"Could not find this route."}

it's ok you did it!
how do the things in your own by seeing the routes/places-routes.js and you can see the routes!

try this:
1. http://localhost:5000/api/places
2. http://localhost:5000/api/places/user/u1
3. http://localhost:5000/api/places/p1
4. http://localhost:5000/api/places/user
